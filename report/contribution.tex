The goal of this work is to implement the quasi-concrete model in CompCert.
In section~\ref{sec:memupdate}, we show how the definitions have been modified to fit into CompCert.
In section~\ref{sec:meminj}, we show how the definition of memory injection has to be modified. It changes a lot of proofs in CompCert.
In section~\ref{sec:mixedsim}, we present how adding non-determinism in every language of CompCert prevents us from using the same correctness proofs. We design a new proof, using mixed simulations. It relies on the observation that non-deterministic behavior is only encountered when using the capture function.
