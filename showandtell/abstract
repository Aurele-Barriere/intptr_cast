Title: Implementing a C Memory Model Supporting Integer-Pointer Casts in CompCert


Abstract:

The ISO C standard does not define semantics for integer-pointer casts. The certified C compiler CompCert uses an abstract memory model which allows for many optimizations, but in which the behavior of such casts is undefined. In [1], Kang et al. present a new formal memory model that supports integer-pointer casts semantics, while still allowing common optimizations.

In this talk, I will present what I did during my internship to implement this model in CompCert.
I present the memory model, its implementation and the changes made to memory injection.
Then I present the new correctness proof of CompCert, using mixed simulations to deal with non-deterministic behaviors.
