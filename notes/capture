Implementing capture on compcert
capture function
when casting, from logical to concrete block
lowering to Clight
Clight : (int)&x has no side effects (goal)

currently, nop, no trace
step semantics in Cexec.v
explicit and implicit casting
parenthesis operator?
simplExpr.v (Compcert C -> Clight)


CompCert memory model
