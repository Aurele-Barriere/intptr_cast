  \begin{exampleblock}{Results}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The new memory model has been implemented in CompCert.
    \item It successfully gives semantics to Integer-Pointer casts.
    \item It allows optimizations.
    \item The proof of correctness is almost finished.
    \item Already added 5kloc of Coq.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exampleblock}
  \vfill
  \begin{block}{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Finish the mixed simulations proofs.
    \item Finish implementation of the integer-pointer cast semantics.
    \end{itemize}
